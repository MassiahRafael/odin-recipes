    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the bread that Ezekiel lived off of while he was in the desert for two years. It is supposed to be nutritionally complete. The recipe calls for grinding your own flour from a variety of grains and dried beans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups wheat berries</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups spelt flour</li>
            <li>½ cup barley</li>
            <li>½ cup millet</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry green lentils</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry great Northern beans</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry kidney beans</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried pinto beans</li>
            <li>4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 cup honey</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
                <p>Measure the water, honey, olive oil, and yeast into a large bowl. Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
                <p>Stir all of the grains and beans together until well mixed. Grind in a flour mill. Add fresh milled flour and salt to the yeast mixture; stir until well mixed, about 10 minutes. The dough will be like that of a batter bread. Pour dough into two greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
                <p>Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until dough has reached the top of the pan.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
                <p>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown.</p>
        </ol>
